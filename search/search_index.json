In this work, we present algorithms that build on recent advances in online discrepancy minimization which accommodate both arbitrary treatment probabilities and multiple treatments. The proposed algorithms are computational efficient, minimize covariate imbalance, and include randomization which enables robustness to misspecification. We provide worst case bounds on the expected mean squared error of the causal estimate and show that the proposed estimator is no worse than an implicit ridge regression, which are within a logarithmic factor of the best known results for offline experimental design. We conclude with a detailed simulation study showing favorable results relative to complete randomization as well as to offline methods for experimental design with time complexities exceeding our algorithm.</p> <p>In short: efficient experimental design in the online setting which maintains strong worst-case guarantees.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#intuition","title":"Intuition","text":"<p>When a covariate profile aligns with the direction of previously observed imbalance, we have an opportunity to decrease imbalance by assigning treatment to push imbalance towards zero. Thus, we do that with slightly higher probability.</p> <p></p> <p>This geometric intuition can be formalized by assigning treatment generally based on the dot-product between these two vectors:</p> \\[x \\cdot w = ||x|| \\cdot ||w|| \\cos \\theta \\leq ||w|| \\cos \\theta\\] <p>where the final inequality comes from the fact that we assume covariate profiles are normalized. Thus, modifying treatment probability proportionally to the dot product obeys the exact geometric property we care about: treatment assignment is pushed farther away from the marginal when there's more opportunity to reduce the magnitude of \\(w\\).</p> <p>To extend this approach to unequal probabilities of treatment requires weighting the observed imbalances. The extension to multiple treatments relies on building a binary tree where each node represents the (weighted) balance problem between two sets of treatment.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#about-us","title":"About us","text":"<p>Check us out in our respective corners of the internet:</p> <ul> <li>David Arbour</li> <li>Drew Dimmery</li> <li>Tung Mai</li> <li>Anup Rao</li> </ul>"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/","title":"Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct","text":""},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#our-pledge","title":"Our Pledge","text":"<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p> <p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#our-standards","title":"Our Standards","text":"<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:</p> <ul> <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li> <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li> <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li> <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,   and learning from the experience</li> <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall   community</li> </ul> <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p> <ul> <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of   any kind</li> <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li> <li>Public or private harassment</li> <li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,   without their explicit permission</li> <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a   professional setting</li> </ul>"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#enforcement-responsibilities","title":"Enforcement Responsibilities","text":"<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p> <p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>"},{"location":"code_of_conduct/#scope","title":"Scope","text":"<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
